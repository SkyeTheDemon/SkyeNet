<br>This project is essentially just a bot for my Discord server 悪魔セスプール/Demon Cesspool, 
it will have some actual genuine uses aside from some joke commands in the near future.
<br>Feel free to join my server with the link right here: [悪魔セスプール/Demon Cesspool](https://discord.gg/u3HX7bY)
<br>You're also welcome to give ideas to add onto the bot itself by DMing Skye who owns the server.

# Updates
### 8/5/2020 SkyeNet/Skye♪ runs 24/7 off of some throwaway aws instance from Lepto, expect crashes frequently.

# Notes
### Token shenanagins
1. create a `config.json` in the root directory
2. fill it with `{ "token": ___ }`
